[Music] this is the last video for this week in this video we are going to study subgame perfect equilibrium we have studied a similar concept that we have learned how to obtain equilibrium in extensive form game using backward induction but we have also seen that in some of the places we cannot do backward induction to take care of those issues we have this concept called subgame perfect equilibrium this is much more technical way of doing things and it encompasses the equilibrium that we obtain using backward induction so just to refresh your memory here we are taking an entry game there is a challenger which is deciding to enter in the market or stay out in the from the market and then there is incumbent Challenger we can say C incumbent is I once Challenger enters the market incomp either fights or accommodates and the payoffs are given and here we can obtain the equivalent normal form game what is the equivalent normal form game here we have already done this is 1 comma 2 1 comma 2 we had done it earlier using different number numbers but it doesn't numbers don't matter they are ordinal anyway these numbers are madeup num so this is in the extensive form and this is in the normal form and what we had said that we can use this extensive we can use backward induction to solve this extensive form game and Challenger would think that incumbent is rational and therefore between fight and accommodate incumbent is going to choose accommodate because accommodate gives one to incumbent and fight gives zero to incumbent so accommodate is definitely better so game is definitely going to move in this direction so Challenger being rational would know that if it decides to enter in the market the payoff to it is going to be two and to incumbent it's going to be one so then Challenger being rational would compare between inter and history out and Inter gives two and history out givs one and therefore Challenger will decide to enter in the market we have already discussed this we are just repeating you can say think it's a recap and here similarly we have written the payoff we can obtain the nas equilibrium here so Nas equilibrium is going to be if incumbent e decides to accommodate the best response is inter e incumbent decides to fight best response is to stay out and if Challenger decides to enter the best response is accommodate if Challenger decides to stay out best strategy is to accommodate or fight and we get two NAS equilibrium inter accommodate and stay out and fight these are two NAS equilibrium and what did we get as equilibrium from backward induction we got in enter comma accommodate what we see that there is an additional equilibrium here in Nas equilibrium which is more probable the way it looks like that in stay out fight what does it mean that Challenger would directly move to stay out because Challenger is worried that here fight would happen and fight would give zero to the Challenger while staying out is giving one so Challenger will right at the beginning will stay out this doesn't look credible why because Challenger knows that incumbent is rational so given a chance to play this game at this node incumbent is going to accommodate so why Challenger you know Challenger would not think that incumbent is going to fight so what is the problem entry game we have already solved what is the problem the problem is that when we are talking about this normal form game we are thinking that even before the game Begins the Challenger is deciding between enter and stay out that's really happening but we are further assuming that incumbent is also right here deciding between fight F sought for fight or accommodate which is not happening in fact when incumbent is deciding between fight and accommodate incumbent gets to observe what Challenger has done so incumbent has that information so challenge incumbent knows that game has already moved but when we are writing in the normal form game we are suppressing this information that incumbent gets to observe the Challenger we pretend we assume that game is being played right at the beginning as if Challenger on a piece of paper writing enter or stay out and incumbent is writing on a piece of paper accommodate or fight and right at the beginning they are deciding there is uncertainty strategic uncertainty and Challenger has some reason to believe that incumbent is going to fight and therefore the best response is to stay out and incumbent think that Challenger is going to stay out so best response is both therefore stay out comma fight in this you get best response of one another and therefore it comes out to to be Nas equilibrium so simply saying that in a stay out comma fight is not credible because once Challenger enters the market incumbent has no option but to accommodate this credibility doesn't come out through the nas equilibrium because all the players are deciding once and for all right at the beginning and this is solved by backward induction backward induction takes care of the sequential nature of the game so it gives a right kind of information right kind of equilibrium but we will see some certain situation where backward induction would not work like for example here is a game in player one is deciding between you and d and if player one decides between U and D player one and two simultaneously move and they basically play a normal form game where player one decides between a and b and player two sides between X and Y how many sub games do we have a sub game is starting here whole game is a sub game another sub game is starting here we cannot see a sub game is starting here we cannot say a sub game is starting here so we cannot treat this part separately then this part separately so backward induction will not work because this node is attached to this node so backward induction is going to fail how to solve such a game other problem is that you have a game where you know uh player keep this action keeps on happening player one play Then player two plays then player one play Then player two plays and it never stops so if there is no end you need an end to start backward induction you are coming from backside we will see such a problem in repeated infinitely repeated game if you do not have a terminal node how can you start backward induction in that case also backward induction fails so we have to come up with a way that takes care of such problem and there we have a notion of what is called subgame perfect equilibrium insort SP and it takes care of the credible threats and it ignores the incredible threats the threats which are not plausible so subgame perfect equilibrium has three things one is subgame second is perfect and third is equilibrium so here again we are talking about some sort of social equilibrium subgame I have already explained to you what is a subgame a perfect notion will become clear whenever we get an equilibrium in extensive form typically we put a Word Perfect there so it's in that sense what is a sub game so if you know if there is is a game like this uh we have the entry game where you have Challenger and incumbent so this node can be taught of you know as a beginning new beginning and so a new game is starting here one can say so this can be treated as a sub game a sub game in all sense a game in itself it follows all the properties of a game okay and so there is another sub game starting right at the beginning so we say that strategy profile that is Nas equilibrium in every proper sub game including the root proper term we can remove also including the root whether or not that subgame is reached along the equilibrium path of the play that will become clear so let us see what we are trying to say Let us look at the game this we have already figured out that here we figured out using backward induction now we can figure out using subgame perfect equilibrium so what we can do we can obtain one way is to that we can obtain Nas equilibrium and there are two NAS equilibrium inter accommodate stay out and fight what we have said for subgame perfect equilibrium whether or not that subgame is reached along the equilibrium path of the player everything is in the equilibrium path that again will become clear but let us look at the how many sub games do we have one whole game is sub game game of itself and second a sub game is starting when incumbent plays so if we use inter comma accommodate it says in the whole game Challenger plays enter and incumbent plays accommodate this is what backward induction is also saying and this is what in you know it's it's inducing nasik behavior in all the sub game this sub game only incumbent is acting and between fight and accommodate accommodate is better so he's playing accommodate that is fine and in the whole game this enter is better so this is fine we can say inter comma accommodate is subgame perfect equilibrium what happens with stay out and fight let us look at this strategy profile what will it induce in the smaller sub game it will say that in a smaller sub game because stay out is no longer possible that's it's not part of this uh smaller sub game one is that five can happen so in this sub game incumbent is going to fight that doesn't make sense because accommodate gives better payoff so incumbent if is going to fight in this sub game it's no longer rational and therefore it's not going to happen so stay out comma fight doesn't induce nash-like behavior in all the sub games and therefore stay out comma fight is not subgame perfect equilibrium while inter comma accommodate induces nash-like Behavior everywhere in all the sub games and therefore it is subgame perfect equilibrium we will see let's look at one more example it will become clear this is a game how many players do we have one and two what is the strategy set for player one player one has a play here and play here at two information set and both the information set player one has two actions so two multiplied by two four strategies are there what are those strategies ux uy DX Dy second is for player two how many strategies only one play player two has so a comma B so what would be the normal form game we can say this is going to be 4x2 Matrix because player one has four stret is ux uy DX Dy and player 2 A and B if player one plays ux and player two plays a because of ux player one will move in this direction because of a player two will move in this direction and this because ux here so it is 1 comma 3 uux comma B where things will come U will take game to this node B will take game to this node and X will take to 0 comma 0 and similarly we can fill this is 0 comma 0 this is 3 comma 1 and then DX Dy doesn't matter what player two does as soon as player one takes d game comes to here so it is 2 comma 2 2 comma 2 2 comma 2 2 comma 2 how many Nas equilibrium do we have we can check if player two is playing a best response from player one is either DX or Dy two is more than one or zero and similarly her best response is uy if player one is playing ux best response is a here best response is B here best responses are both A and B so what do we get here we have an AS equilib here we also have a Nas equilibrium here also we have Nas equilibrium so there are three Nas equilibrium uy comma B then DX comma a and then d y comma B how many of these are subgame perfect equilibrium let us look at it how many sub games do we have there are only two sub games one starting St in at this point another one starting at this node a sub game cannot start here a sub game cannot start here because you need to have only one route and these are connected to one another remember a sub game starts at only Singleton information set information set which has only one node so if in this sub game because you know in this sub game what would be the operational part of you y comma B that player one is playing Y and player two is playing B so y comma B what is going to happen here the P off is going to be 3 comma 1 and therefore player one will choose U because 3 comma 1 and here 2 comma 2 3 is more than two so player one will choose U so from u y comma B this is subgame perfect because it induces nasik Behavior everywhere how about DX comma a x comma a it means here you will have 1 comma 3 2 is more than one so player will choose player one will choose D so DX comma a is again subgame perfect equilibrium now DX comma B in this sub game what DX comma B says that player one will play X and player two will play B and they will get 0 comma 0 in this game sub game which can also be represented by let us say x y a b and x a is 1 comma 3 3 comma 1 0 comma 0 0 comma 0 this Nas equilibrium says that they will end up here which doesn't make any sense because they both can do better so this is not a subgame perfect equilibrium but this is a Nas equilibrium this is the way we obtain subgame perfect equilibrium there is another example that in Bertrand competition we had this again I'm not going to solve because you have already solved it this firm one is deciding q1 and then firm two is deciding Q2 you can see now how did we solve because for one is deciding q1 when it is deciding q1 form one will because thinking forward and Looking Backward also so form two will take q1 as given so as a function Q2 will come out as a function of q1 so when firm one is deciding it will account it will not take any Q2 form one knows that if it decides q1 Q2 is automatic Al decided so that's how we solve the bend competition but we had already seen in earlier course how to solve it so just to say every subgame perfect equilibrium is a Nas equilibrium the way we have obtained I will tell you the shortcut also wherever you can use backward induction please do use backward induction it will give you subgame perfect equilibrium and if you cannot use sub backward induction then the technique that I just told you would be very useful for you so again let me repeat a subgame perfect equilibrium is a strategy profile that induces a Nas equilibrium in every sub game so that's it for subgame perfect equilibrium for our purpose backward induction will do but it's good idea to understand what's happening we have technique to obtain subgame perfect equilibrium or an equilibrium in such settings thank you
